And your fingers start a-poppin'  
And your feet start a-movin' around

1,The Beatles,Across The Universe,"Words are flowing out like  
Endless rain into a paper cup  
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.  
Pools of sorrow waves of joy

Possessing and caressing me.  
  
Jai Guru Deva. Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
  
Images of broken light, which  
Dance before me like a million eyes,  
They call me on and on across the universe.  
Thoughts meander like a  
Restless wind inside a letter box  
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.  
  
Jai Guru Deva. Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world

Are ringing through my opened ears  
Inciting and inviting me.  
Limitless undying love, which  
Shines around me like a million suns,  
It calls me on and on across the universe  
  
Jai Guru Deva, om.  
Nothing's gonna change my world

And he began to cry.

I got no daddy's smile.  
Nobody wants me,  
I'm nobody's child.  
  
No mummy's arms to hold me  
Or sue me when I cry,  
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome  
I wish that I could die.  
I'll walk the streets of heaven  
Where all blinds can see.  
  
And just like for the other kids  
It will be a home for me.

He blew his mind out in a car  
He didn't notice that the red lights had changed  
A crowd of people stood and stared  
They'd seen his face before  
Nobody was really sure  
If he was from the House of Lords.  
  
I saw a film today, oh boy  
The English army had just won the war  
A crowd of people turned away  
But I just had to look  
Having read the book  
I'd love to turn you on.  
  
Woke up, fell out of bed,  
Dragged a comb across my head  
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,  
And looking up I noticed I was late.  
  
Found my coat and grabbed my hat  
Made the bus in seconds flat  
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,  
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream.  
  
I read the news today oh boy  
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire  
And though the holes were rather small  
They had to count them all  
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.  
I'd love to turn you on.

When I'm with you I want to stay there  
If I'm true I'll never leave  
And if I do I know the way there  
  
Ooh then I suddenly see you  
Ooh did I tell you I need you  
Every single day of my life  
Got to get you into my life  
I've got to get you into my life  
  
I was alone, I took a ride  
I didn't know what I would find there  
Another road where maybe I  
Could see another kind of mind there  
  
And suddenly I see you  
Did I tell you I need you  
Every single day...

You know I love you still  
Will I wait a lonely lifetime  
If you want me to-- I will.  
  
For if I ever saw you  
I didn't catch your name  
But it never really mattered  
I will always feel the same.  
  
Love you forever and forever  
Love you with all my heart  
Love you whenever we're together  
Love you when we're apart.  
  
And when at last I find you  
Your song will fill the air  
Sing it loud so I can hear you  
Make it easy to be near you  
For the things you do endear you to me  
You know I will  
I will.

114,The Beatles,If I Fell,"If I fell in love with you  
Would you promise to be true  
And help me understand  
'Cause I've been in love before  
And I found that love was more  
Than just holding hands  
  
If I give my heart to you  
I must be sure  
From the very start  
That you would love me more than her  
  
If I trust in you oh please  
Don't run and hide  
If I love you too oh please  
Don't hurt my pride like her  
  
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain  
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain  
  
So I hope you see that I  
Would love to love you  
And that she will cry  
When she learns we are two  
If I fell in love with you

Everywhere, it's what you make  
For us to take, it's all too much  
  
Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me  
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be  
  
It's all too much for me to take  
The love that's shining all around here  
All the world's a birthday cake,  
So take a piece but not too much  
  
Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free  
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea  
  
It's all to much for me to see  
A love that's shining all around here  
The more I am, the less I know  
And what I do is all too much  
  
It's all too much for me to take  
The love that's shining all around you  
Everywhere, it's what you make  
For us to take, it's all too much  
  
It's too much...It's too much  
  
Too much too much too much

138,The Beatles,Jingle Bells,"Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh  
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way  
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!  
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!  
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh  
  
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride  
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side  
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot  
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
A day or two ago, the story I must tell  
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell  
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh  
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young  
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song  
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed  
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead  
  
[Chorus:]

139,The Beatles,Johnny B. Goode,"Deep down in Louisianna  
Close to New Orleans  
Way back up in the woods  
Among the evergreens  
There stand a country cabin  
Made of clay and wood  
Where lives a young country boy  
Named Johnny B. Goode  
He never ever learned  
To read or write a book so well  
But he could play his guitar  
Just like a-ringing a bell  
  
Go go, go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Aah Johnny B. Goode!  
  
He used to carry his guitar  
In a gunny sack  
Sit beneath the trees  
By the railroad track  
Oh sitting and a-playing  
In the shade  
Drumming to the rhythm  
That the drivers made  
People passing by  
Used to stop and say  
My oh my  
That country boy can play  
  
Go go, go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Aah Johnny B. Goode!  
  
Well his mama told him  
Someday you will be a man  
And you will be the leader  
Of a big old band  
Many people coming  
From miles around  
To hear you play your music  
Till the sun goes down  
Maybe some day  
Your name will be in light  
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!  
  
Go go, go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Aah Johnny B.Goode!

I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.  
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, I'm in love with you.  
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, I'm telling you.

Not worrying what they or you say I'll live and love and maybe someday  
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.  
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can't reject.  
I'm changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together  
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.  
  
That love of your, to miss that love is something I'd hate.  
I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not late.
